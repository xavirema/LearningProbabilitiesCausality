HOW TO COMPILE

The only thing to know is that the slides depend on the "notes" to number the exercises and remarks consistently. So:

1. Compile the notes.tex with your favourite latex compiler (with the usual three-times compilation to be sure that everything is smooth).
2. You can compile now any slides chapter.
